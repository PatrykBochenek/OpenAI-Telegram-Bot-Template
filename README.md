# OpenAI-Telegram-Bot-Template

This is a simple template to create a telegram bot which utilises the OpenAI API to formulate responses to the user.

Some pre-requisites are required to use this template successfully:

  1.) An OpenAI API key. For this you need an OpenAI account with an attached payment method. 
   
  2.) Telegram bot & a bot authorisation token. How to create your bot and how to get its respective authorisation token is explained in section 2 below.
  
Both of these keys are then to be pasted into the constants.py file. 

```python
import os
```
